# Changes introduced since the SDK R4

Whole API is crafted with the use of TMF tooling. At this moment some descriptions might differ from previous version.
The details of descriptions will be worked on during the MEF 115 Quote Management Developer Guide project and will be updated in next release.

The API is based on newest TMF 622 rel. 19.0 (v4.0.0). The rules of Domain Context Specialization were followed. DCS rules are developed by the [MEF-TMF-ONAP-Collaboration](https://wiki.mef.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=106608028) project and ensure API compliance.
