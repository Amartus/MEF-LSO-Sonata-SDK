    **GeographicAddress Management**

    This API allows to:

    *Retrieve a geographic address in seller database from an address id for a buyer
    *Validate geographic address data. Buyer will trigger an address validation request to get a valid address description and id from seller

    **In MEF context following restrictions apply:**
    Only POST operation for resource geographicAddressValidation is used.
    Event Subscription is not managed.
    Operation GET for geographicAddress could be only done with an id.

    Geographic Address API uses TMF 673 as template.
