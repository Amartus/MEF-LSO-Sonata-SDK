    OVC Service Attributes control the behavior observable at and
    between External Interfaces to the Carrier Ethernet Network (CEN).
    The behaviors are achieved by the Network Operator and the Operator's
    client (the Service Provider in this case) agreeing on the value
    for each of the Service Attributes.

                    the OVC End Point Envelopes Service Attribute can be used when
                    all of the Bandwidth Profile Flows contained in the Envelope are
                    specific to a given OVC End Point; that is, they are specified
                    using one of the following OVC End Point Service Attributes: Ingress
                    Bandwidth Profile Per OVC End Point, Egress Bandwidth Profile Per
                    OVC End Point, Ingress Bandwidth Profile Per Class of Service Name,

                    than one OVC End Point, the UNI or ENNI Envelopes Service Attribute
                    (as appropriate) must be used.

                    VLAN IDs) to an ordered list of physical links if EnniService.sVlanIdControl
                    is FULL and there are multiple physical links in the ENNI and EnniCommon.linkAggregation
                    is ALL_ACTIVE. Only S-VLAN IDs that are listed in the AccessElineOvcEndPoint.ovcEndPointMap
                    can be listed in this attribute. <br>If EnniService.sVlanIdControl
                    is PARTIAL then the Service Provider does not have full visibility
                    of all the S-VLAN IDs mapped to each physical link, and hence cannot
                    pick values that avoid overloading certain links. In this case,
                    the ENNI Port Conversation to Aggregation Link Map Common Attribute
                    must be agreed between the relevant Operators.
