    MEF LSO Sonata - Carrier Ethernet ENNI Service (Inventory) Product Specification

description:  >-
    For each instance of an ENNI, there are multiple sets of ENNI
    Service Attributes. The value for each ENNI Service Attribute in
    a set for an Operator CEN is specific to a SP/SO that is using
    the ENNI per Section 8.11 of MEF 26.2. Each such value is agreed
    to by the SP/SO and the Operator.

            MEF 26.2 §13.2 - The value of the S-VLAN ID Control Service
            Attribute is FULL or PARTIAL. When the value is FULL, the Operator
            can support only a single SP/SO at the ENNI. In other words, S-VLAN
            IDs at the ENNI can only be mapped to OVC End Points for a single
            SP/SO. When the value is PARTIAL, there can be multiple SP/SOs
            using the ENNI and different S-VLAN IDs can be mapped to OVC End
            Points for different SP/SOs.

            MEF 26.2 §13.3 - The value of the Maximum Number of OVCs Service
            Attribute is a strictly positive integer. It provides an upper
            bound on the number of OVCs that the Operator will support at the
            ENNI for the SP/SO.

            MEF 26.2 §13.4 - Usually each OVC has a single End Point at
            the ENNI but with hairpin switching an OVC can have multiple. This
            Service Attribute sets the limit on the number of End Points an
            OVC can have at the ENNI.

            Profile Envelopes containing more than one Bandwidth Profile Flow
            are supported by the Service Provider at the ENNI.

            ENNI can also be specified at the OVC End Points associated with
            the ENNI.
