# 1. Abstract

This standard is intended to assist implementation of the Address Validation
functionality defined for the LSO Sonata Interface Reference Point (IRP), for
which requirements and use cases are defined in MEF 79 _Address, Service Site,
and Product Offering Qualification Management Requirements and Use Cases_
[[mef79](#8-references)] and MEF W79.0.2 _Amendment to MEF 79: Address
Validation_ [[mef79.0.2](#8-references)]. This standard consists of this
document and complementary API definitions.

This standard normatively incorporates the following file by reference as if it

# 4. Introduction

This standard specification document describes the Application Programming
Interface (API) for Address Validation functionality of the LSO Sonata
Interface Reference Point (IRP) as defined in the MEF 55 _Lifecycle Service
Orchestration (LSO): Reference Architecture and Framework_
[[mef55](#8-references)]. The LSO Reference Architecture is shown in Figure 1
with the Sonata IRP highlighted.

![Figure 1: The LSO Reference Architecture](media/lsoArchitecture.png)

**Figure 1. The LSO Reference Architecture**

The Sonata IRP defines pre-ordering and ordering functionalities that allow an
automated exchange of information between business applications of the Service
Provider (Buyer) and Partner (Seller) Domains. Those are:

- Address Validation
- Site Retrieval
- Product Offering Qualification
- Product Quote
- Product Inventory
- Product Ordering
- Trouble Ticketing
- Billing

The business requirements and use cases for Address Validation are defined in
_Address, Service Site, and Product Offering Qualification Management
Requirements and Use Cases_ (MEF 79) [[mef79](#8-references)] and _Amendment to
MEF 79: Address Validation_ (MEF W79.0.2) [[mef79.0.2](#8-references)].

This document focuses on implementation aspects of Address Validation
functionality and is structured as follows:

[Chapter 4](#4-introduction) provides an introduction to Address Validation and
its description in a broader context of Sonata and Sonata SDK.  
[Chapter 5](#5-api-description) gives an overview of endpoints, resource model
and design patterns.  
Use cases and flows are presented in
[Chapter 6](#6-api-interactions-and-flows).  
And finally, [Chapter 7](#7-api-details) complements previous sections with a
detailed API description.

## 4.1. Description

The point of Address Validation API is to ensure that the Buyer and th Seller
understand each other in terms of address representation. It is often the case
that the same address may be represented in various ways. There are also the
cases where the address might be ambiguous or there is no address at all.

The other purpose is obtain the Seller's Address Identifier so that Buyer may
refer to it by reference hence speeding up the latter conversation.

### 4.1.1. Conventions in the Document

Code samples are formatted using code blocks. When notation `<< some text >>`
is used in the payload sample it indicates that a comment is provided instead
of an example value and it might not comply with the OpenAPI definition.  
Model definitions are formatted as in-line code (e.g. `GeographicAddress`). In
UML figures the default cardinality of associations is `0..1`. In UML sequence
diagrams `{{variable}}` notation is used to indicate a variable to be
substituted with a correct value.

## 4.2. Relation to Other Documents

The requirements and use cases for Address Validation functionality are defined
in MEF 79 [[mef79](#8-references)] and MEF 79.0.2 [[mef79.0.2](#8-references)].
The API definition builds on TMF 673 API as specified by _TMF673 Geographic
Address Management API User Guide_ [[tmf673](#8-references)].

## 4.3. Approach

As presented in Figure 2. the Sonata API framework consists of three structural
components:

- Generic API framework
- Product-independent information (Function-specific information and
  Function-specific operations)
- Product-specific information (MEF product specification data model)

![Figure 2. Sonata API framework](media/lsoApiStructure.png)

**Figure 2. Sonata API framework**

The essential concept behind the framework is to decouple the common structure,
information and operations from the specific product information content.  
Firstly, the Generic API Framework defines a set of design rules and patterns
that are applied across all Sonata API suites throughout all LSO Interface
Reference Points' APIs.  
Secondly, the product-independent information of the framework focuses on a
model of a particular Sonata functionality and is agnostic to any of the
product specifications.  
Finally, the product-specific information part of the framework focuses on MEF
product specifications that define business-relevant attributes and
requirements for trading MEF subscriber and MEF operator services.

The Address Validation API is product-agnostic in it's nature and is not
intended to carry any product-specific payloads. It operates using the Generic
API Framework and the Function-specific Information and Operations.

## 4.4. High-Level Flow

Address Validation is part of a broader End-to-End Sonata flow. Figure 3. below
shows a high-level diagram to get a good understanding of the whole process and
Address Validation's position within it.

![Figure 3. Sonata End-to-End Flow](media/sonataEndToEndFlowAddress.png)

**Figure 3. Sonata End-to-End Flow**

- Address Validation
  - Allows the Buyer to retrieve address information from the Seller, including
    exact formats, for addresses known to the Seller.
- Site Query
  - Allows the Buyer to retrieve Service Site information including exact
    formats for Service Sites known to the Seller.
- Product Offering Qualification (POQ)
  - Allows the Buyer to determine whether it is feasible for the Seller to
    deliver a particular Product with a given configuration to a particular
    geographic location.
- Quoting
  - Supports the inter-carrier Product Quote process over the Sonata interface.
- Product Ordering
  - Supports the inter-carrier Product Ordering process over the Sonata
    interface.

# 5. API Description

This section discusses the API structure and design patterns. It starts with
the high-level use cases diagram and then it describes the REST endpoints with
use case mapping.

## 5.1. High-level use cases

Figure 4 presents a high-level use case diagram as specified in MEF 79
[[mef79](#8-references)] for Address Validation in section 7.1. This picture
aims to help understand the endpoint mapping. Use cases are described
extensively in [chapter 6](#6-api-interactions-and-flows)

![Figure 4: Use cases](media/useCases.png)

**Figure 4. High-level use cases**

## 5.2. Resource/endpoint Description

### 5.2.1. Seller Side Endpoints

**Base URL**
`https://{{server}}:{{port}}/mefApi/sonata/geographicAddressManagement/v6/`

Following endpoints are exposed by the Seller and allow the Buyer to:

- Validate geographic address data
- Retrieve a geographic address by identifier from Seller's database.

The endpoints and corresponding data model are defined in
`api/serviceability/address/v5/geographicAddressManagement.api.yaml`.

| API endpoint                        | Description                                                                                                       | MEF 79 Use case Mapping              |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `POST /geographicAddressValidation` | A request initiated by the Buyer to validate the address representation and get the seller address `id`           | UC 1: Validate Address               |
| `GET /geographicAddress/{id}`       | A request initiated by the Buyer to retrieve full details of a single `GeographicAddress` based on an identifier. | UC 2: Retrieve Address by Identifier |

[R XXX] The Buyer implementation **MUST** be able to use both of the above
listed endpoints **[MEF79 R1]**

### 5.2.2. Specifying the Buyer ID and the Seller ID

A business entity willing to represent multiple Buyers or multiple Sellers must
follow requirements of MEF 79 [[mef79](#8-references)] chapter 8.8, which
states:

> For requests of all types, there is a business entity that is initiating an
> Operation (called a Requesting Entity) and a business entity that is
> responding to this request (called the Responding Entity). In the simplest
> case, the Requesting Entity is the Buyer and the Responding Entity is the
> Seller. However, in some cases, the Requesting Entity may represent more than
> one Buyer and similarly, the Responding Entity may represent more than one
> Seller.
>
> While it is outside the scope of this specification, it is assumed that the
> Requesting Entity and the Responding Entity are aware of each other and can
> authenticate requests initiated by the other party. It is further assumed
> that both the Buying Entity and the Requesting Entity know:
>
> a) the list of Buyers the Requesting Entity represents when interacting with
> this Responding Entity;and  
> b) the list of Sellers that this Responding Entity represents to this
> Requesting Entity.

In the API the `buyerId` and `sellerId` are represented as query parameters in
each operation defined in `productOfferingQualificationManagement.api.yaml` and
as a specialized event (`PoqEvent`) attributes as described in
`productOfferingQualificationNotification.api.yaml`.

[RXXX] If the Requesting Entity has the authority to represent more than one
Buyer the request **MUST** include `buyerId` query parameter that identifies
the Buyer being represented [MEF79 R80]

[RXXX] If the Requesting Entity represents precisely one Buyer with the
Responding Entity, the request **MUST NOT** specify the `buyerId` [MEF79 R81]

[RXXX] If the Responding Entity represents more than one Seller to this Buyer
the request **MUST** include `sellerId` query parameter that identifies the
Seller with whom this request is associated [MEF79 R82]

[RXXX] If the Responding Entity represents precisely one Seller to this Buyer,
the request **MUST NOT** specify the `sellerId` [MEF79 R83]

[RXXX] If `buyerId` or `sellerId` attributes were specified in the request same
attributes **MUST**

## 5.3. API Resource Schema summary

This subchapter describes the entities from the resource model included in the
API specification.

Each entity is a simple or composed type (with the use of `allOf` keyword for
data types composition). A simple type defines a set of properties that might
be of an object, primitive, or reference type.

[Section 6](#6-api-interactions-and-flows) provides examples of data model and
API usage. For a detailed description of the data model, please refer to
[API Details](#7-api-details).

Figure 5 presents the whole data model of the API.

![Figure 5: Data Model](media/addressModelNoErrors.png)

**Figure 5. Data Model**

**_Note:_** While showing the extends relation, for clarity, the extending type
lists only added attributes, not the sum with the extended type.

`GeographicAddressValidation_Create` is a subset of the
`GeographicAddressValidation` model and is used as a request message. It
contains only attributes that must be set by the Buyer. The Seller then
enriches the entity in the response with additional information of
`bestMatchGeographicAddress` and `alternateGeographicAddress`.

[R_XXX] If an entity is used in the request or response, all properties marked
as required (\*) **MUST** be provided.

The root class of address representation is the `GeographicAddress`. It is used
by both the Buyer and the Seller, yet it is only the Seller that can set the
`readOnly=true` attributes in the response. Those are:

- `href`
- `allowsNewSite`
- `hasPublicSite`
- `associatedGeographicAddress`

The address representation may take one of four types:

- `FieldedAddress`
- `FormattedAddress`
- `GeographicAddressIdentifier`
- `MEFGeographicPoint`

[R_XXX] A Buyer **MUST** support at least one of Fielded Addresses or Formatted
Addresses to describe locations. [MEF79 R84]

[R_XXX] A Seller **MUST** support at least one of Fielded Addresses or
Formatted Addresses to specify a location. [MEF79 R85]

The mandatory `@type` attribute of `GeographicAddress` is used as a
discriminator. It is possible for the Buyer and the Seller to go beyond those
four specified type. This can be done with the use of the `@schemaLocation`
attribute that will point to the schema defining the model of the new agreed
address representation. Using additional address schema must be bilaterally
agreed during the onboarding process.

### 5.3.1. Fielded Address

```json
{
  "@type": "FieldedAddress",
  "streetNr": "20",
  "streetNrSuffix": "14",
  "streetName": "Edmunda Wasilewskiego",
  "city": "Kraków",
  "stateOrProvince": "Lesser Poland",
  "postcode": "30-305",
  "country": "Poland",
  "geographicSubAddress": {
    "levelType": "floor",
    "levelNumber": "4"
  }
}
```

Fielded address example of a place specification. The type discriminator has
the value `FieldedAddress`. A subset of available attributes is used to
describe the place. The fielded address has an optional `geographicSubAddress`
structure that defines several attributes that can be used in case precise
address information has to be provided. In the example above, a floor in the
building at the given address is specified using this structure.

### 5.3.2. Formatted Address

```json
{
  "@type": "FormattedAddress",
  "addrLine1": "ul. Edmunda Wasilewskiego 20/14",
  "addrLine2": "Floor 4",
  "city": "Kraków",
  "stateOrProvince": "Lesser Poland",
  "postcode": "30-305",
  "country": "Poland"
}
```

Place information in a form of formatted address. The type discriminator has
the value `FormattedAddress`. This example contains the same information as the
previous `FieldedAddress` example.

### 5.3.3. Geographic Point

```json
{
  "@type": "MEFGeographicPoint",
  "spatialRef": "EPSG:4326 WGS 84",
  "geographicPoint": {
    "x": "50.048868",
    "y": "19.929523"
  }
}
```

Place information in a form of geographic point. `spatialRef` determines the
standard that has to be used to interpret coordinates provided in `x`
(latitude), `y` (longitude), and `z` (elevation) values.

This type allows only providing a point. It cannot carry more detailed
information like the floor number from previous examples.

### 5.3.4. Geographic Address Identifier

```json
{
  "@type": "GeographicAddressIdentifier",
  "externalReferenceType": "CLLI",
  "externalReferenceId": "PLTXCL01"
}
```

The Geographic Address Identifier represents a unique identifier controlled by
a generally accepted independent administrative authority that specifies a
fixed geographical location. The example above is a place that represents a
CLLI (Common Language Location Identifier) identifier which is commonly used to
refer locations in North America for network equipment installations.

## 5.4. Model Structural Validation

The structure of the HTTP payloads exchanged via Address Validation API
endpoints is defined using OpenAPI version 2.0.

**_Note_**: It will be migrated to OAS 3.0 together with all Sonata APIs for
the next release

[R_XXX] Implementations **MUST** use payloads that conform to these
definitions.

## 5.5. Security Considerations

There must be an authentication mechanism whereby a Seller can be assured who a
Buyer is and vice-versa. There must also be authorization mechanisms in place
to control what a particular Buyer or Seller is allowed to do and what
information may be obtained. However, the definition of the exact security
mechanism is outside the scope of this document. nie

**Table 2. Use cases description**

The detailed business requirements of each of the use cases are described in
sections 7.2, 8.1, and 8.9 of MEF 79 [[mef79](#8-references)].

## 6.1. Use case 1: Validate Address

To send a Validate Address Request the Buyer uses the
`createGeographicAddressValidation` operation from the API:
`POST /geographicAddressValidation`.

The flow is a simple request - response pattern, as presented on Figure 6:

![Figure 6: Validate Address Flow](media/addressValidationFlow.png)

**Figure 6. Validate Address Flow**

### 6.1.1 Address Validation Request

`GeographicAddressValidation_Create:`

```json
{
  "provideAlternative": true,
  "submittedGeographicAddress": {
    "@type": "FieldedAddress",
    "streetNr": "20",
    "streetName": "E. Wasilewskiego",
    "city": "Krakow",
    "postcode": "30-305",
    "country": "Poland"
  }
}
```

`GeographicAddressValidation_Create` is the starting entity. The Buyer submits
own representation of the Address in one of four types. Type's specific
required attributes must be set.

[R_XXX] The Buyer **MUST** specify the `submittedGeographicAddress` by
providing whichever Address type by value.

[R_XXX] The Buyer **MUST NOT** specify the `submittedGeographicAddress.id` in
the request. [MEF79 R89], [MEF79 R94], [MEF79.0.2 A2-R13], [MEF79.0.2 R89]

Additionally the `provideAlternative` must be set. MEF mandates it to be always
set to `true` and allows the Seller to make an implementation that only behaves
in this way. The field is present in the API because of the TMF API compliance,
where this attribute is required and MEF cannot remove it.

[R_XXX] The value of `GeographicAddressValidation_Create.provideAlternative`
**MUST** be always set to `true`.

### 6.1.2 Address Validation Response

After receiving the request, the Seller validates it. If validation is
successful a success response will be provided. Then the Seller attempts to
match the Buyer’s provided address with own address information. If the request
filter criteria match one or more Addresses known to the Seller, it is returned
with the address information including (optionally) an Address Identifier for
each Address returned.

**_Note_** Having and Address Validated does not provide any information of
whether the Seller is able to serve any type of Product there. It only assures
that the Seller will understand and accept the request in further steps. The
Seller might as well assign the `id` during providing the response.

[D XXX] When the Seller is asked for a valid Address that does not have an `id`
assigned yet (e.g. in case of `MEFGeographicPoint` or
`GeographicAddressIdentifier`), the Seller **SHOULD** assign the `id` and
provide it in the response.

[D XXX] If validated address has an `id` provided, then it **SHOULD** be used
in latter Sonata steps so that the Seller does not have to validate the Address
each time.

The Seller responds with the `GeographicAddressValidation`:

```json
{
  "provideAlternative": "true", << as provided by the Buyer >>
  "alternateGeographicAddress": [
    {
      "@type": "FieldedAddress",
      "id": "00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002010",

      "streetNr": "20",
      "streetNrSuffix": "10",
      "streetName": "Edmunda Wasilewskiego",
      "streetType": "street",
      "city": "Kraków",
      "stateOrProvince": "Lesser Poland",
      "postcode": "30-305",
      "country": "Poland"
    },
    {
      "@type": "FieldedAddress",
      "id": "00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002014",
      "href": "{{baseUrl}}/geographicAddress/00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002014",
      "allowsNewSite": "true",

      "streetNrSuffix": "14",
      "streetName": "Edmunda Wasilewskiego",
      "streetType": "street",
      "city": "Kraków",
      "stateOrProvince": "Lesser Poland",
      "postcode": "30-305",
      "country": "Poland"
    }
  ],
  "bestMatchGeographicAddress": {
    "@type": "FieldedAddress",
    "id": "00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002000",
    "href": "{{baseUrl}}/geographicAddress/00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002000",
    "allowsNewSite": "true",
    "hasPublicSite": "true",
    "streetNr": "20",
    "streetName": "Edmunda Wasilewskiego",
    "streetType": "street",
    "city": "Kraków",
    "stateOrProvince": "Lesser Poland",
    "postcode": "30-305",
    "country": "Poland"
  },
  "submittedGeographicAddress": { << as provided by the Buyer >>
    "@type": "FieldedAddress",
    "streetNr": "20",
    "streetName": "E. Wasilewskiego",
    "city": "Krakow",
    "postcode": "30-305",
    "country": "Poland"
  }
}
```

[R_XXX] Any attribute set by the Buyer in the request **MUST NOT** be modified
by the Seller in the response.

[R_XXX] The Seller **MUST** respond with the same Address Type as was provided
in the request. [MEF79 R10], [MEF79 R11], [MEF79.0.2 A2-R5], [MEF79.0.2 A2-R6]

[D_XXX] When specifying a `FieldedAddress` or `FormattedAddress`, the Seller
**SHOULD** specify the `GeographicAddress.id`. [MEF79 D7], [MEF79 D8]

[R_XXX] When specifying a `GeographicPoint` or `GeographicAddressIdentifier`,
the Seller **MUST** specify the `GeographicAddress.id`. [MEF79.0.2 A2-R9],
[MEF79.0.2 A2-R17]

[R_XXX] To a request placed with a `GeographicPoint` or
`GeographicAddressIdentifier`, the Seller **MUST** respond only providing the
`bestMatchGeographicAddress`. This is because those types thanks to the
external authority already uniquely identify an address and there is no chance
of different notations etc. Only the Seller Address Identifier may be added.

Please note the details of the response:

Returned Addresses have attributes coming from the parent `GeographicAddress`
that are common for each Address Type:

- `id` and `href` to allow referencing them by the Buyer in latter steps of
  Sonata IRP.
- `allowsNewSite` - to specify if a Buyer must use one of the known existing
  Service Sites at this location for any Products delivered to this Address.
- `hasPublicSite` - to specify if the Address contains Service Sites that are
  public such (e.g. MeetMe-Rooms)

The `allowsNeSite` and `hasPublicSite` attributes are forcing the Seller to
combine the Address domain data with the Service Site domain data. Thus it is
up to Seller decision to populate these attributes. Not having these attributes
provided neither having them set to `false` does mean that the Buyer cannot
proceed with using the validated address in further steps.

[R XXX] The Buyer **MUST NOT** mandate the Seller to provide `allowsNeSite` and
`hasPublicSite` attributes.

`FieldedAddress` objects in the response are enriched to reflect the full
representation available in the Seller's system:

- `streetType`
- `streetNrSuffix`
- `stateOrProvince`
- `geographicSubAddress`

Additionally the Seller has corrected 2 fields in order to match own
representation of the Address:

- `streetName`: from value `"E. Wasilewskiego"` to `"Edmunda Wasilewskiego"`
- `city`: from value `"Krakow"` to `"Kraków"`

The response contains a `bestMatchGeographicAddress` if found, and a list of
`alternateGeographicAddress`, if any. In the example above the Seller decided
to return a best match and 2 alternatives. That means that in the Seller's
system there are 3 Addresses matching the Sellers Criteria (`country`, `city`,
`streetName`) out of which one was selected to be a best match.

While it is up to Seller's discretion to decide on what constitutes a best
match and alternative Addresses, these rules are recommended:

- best match should be the address reflecting the level of details provided in
  the request. In the example above the request provided a `streetName` and
  `streetNr` to point to a building. The Seller has three matching Addresses:
  one for the building and two for offices within it. The Address of the
  building is chosen as the best match because the offices are more specific
  and additionally contain the `streetNrSuffix`.

- an Address of different level of specification should be returned as an
  alternative one. Referring to the example - assuming there was building
  address in Seller's system and only the offices - they should all be marked
  as alternatives (even if the Seller by any reason prioritizes one over the
  other) because the additionally specify the `streetNrSuffix`. The same
  applies when matched Address would be of less detailed specification e.g.
  containing only `streetName` and no `streetNr`.

- the `alternateGeographicAddress` is not expected to be a sorted by any
  criteria.

[R XXX] In case of no matching addresses found, the Seller **MUST** return a
valid 200 response with an empty list of `bestMatchGeographicAddress` and
`alternateGeographicAddress`.

[D XXX] In case of no matching addresses found, the Seller **SHOULD** return a
valid 200 response with `validationStatus=fail`.

[R XXX] In case of too many matching addresses found (the definition of 'too
many' is up to Seller's discretion), the Seller **MUST** return an `Error422`
with `code=tooManyRecords`.

[O XXX] If the `GeographicPoint` is used in the request, the Seller may decide
to additionally enrich the response with the `associatedGeographicAddress` to
provide the `FieldedAddress` describing the location pointed by the
coordinates. [MEF79.0.2 A2-O1]

## 6.2. Use case 2: Retrieve Address by Identifier

To get detailed and up do date information about the Address, the Buyer sends a
Retrieve Address by Identifier Request using a `GET /geographicAddress/{id}`
operation.

![Figure 7: Retrieve Address by Identifier Flow](media/retrieveAddressByIdentifierFlow.png)

**Figure 7. Retrieve Address by Identifier Flow**

Example request and response:

`GET /mefApi/sonata/geographicAddressManagement/v6/geographicAddress/00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002014`

```json
{
  "@type": "FieldedAddress",
  "id": "00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002014",
  "href": "{{baseUrl}}/geographicAddress/00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002014",
  "allowsNewSite": "true",
  "hasPublicSite": "true",
  "streetNr": "20",
  "streetNrSuffix": "14",
  "streetName": "Edmunda Wasilewskiego",
  "streetType": "street",
  "city": "Kraków",
  "stateOrProvince": "Lesser Poland",
  "postcode": "30-305",
  "country": "Poland",
  "geographicSubAddress": {
    "levelType": "floor",
    "levelNumber": "4"
  }
}
```

`GET /mefApi/sonata/geographicAddressManagement/v6/geographicAddress/00000000-0000-5004-8868-000019929523`

```json
{
  "@type": "MEFGeographicPoint",
  "id": "00000000-0000-5004-8868-000019929523",
  "href": "{{baseUrl}}/geographicAddress/00000000-0000-5004-8868-000019929523",
  "allowsNewSite": "true",
  "hasPublicSite": "false",
  "spatialRef": "EPSG:4326 WGS 84",
  "geographicPoint": {
    "x": "50.048868",
    "y": "19.929523",
    "z": "0"
  }
}
```

[R XXX] In case `id` does not allow to find a `GeographicAddress` in Seller's
system, an error response `404` **MUST** be returned.

[R XXX] `GeographicAddress.id` **MUST** be unique among all types of
`GeographicAddresses` in the Seller's system.

Because of the above the Buyer does not have to specify the Address type in the
request.

# 7. API Details

## 7.1. API patterns

### 7.1.1. Indicating errors

Erroneous situations are indicated by appropriate HTTP responses. An error
response is indicated by HTTP status 4xx (for client errors) or 5xx (for server
errors) and appropriate response payload. The Address Validation API uses the
error responses depicted and described below.

![Figure 8. Data model types to represent an erroneous response](media/addressErrorModel.png)

**Figure 8. Data model types to represent an erroneous response**

#### 7.1.1.1. Type Error

**Description:** Standard Class used to describe API response error Not
intended to be used directly. The `code` in the HTTP header is used as a

The response for HTTP status `422` is a list of elements that are structured
using `Error422` data type. Each list item describes a business validation
problem. This type introduces the `propertyPath` attribute which points to the
erroneous property of the request, so that the Buyer may fix it easier. It is
highly recommended that this property should be used, yet remains optional
because it might be hard to implement.
